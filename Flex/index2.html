                <p>But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
                    Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
                    I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined

                <p>I should not be left to my own devices
                    They come with prices and vices
                    I end up in crisis
                    (Tale as old as time)
                    I wake up screaming from dreaming
                    One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
                    'Cause you got tired of my scheming
                    (For the last time)</p>

                    Made you the one I've fallen for
                    Every dead-end street led you straight to me
                    Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for

                <p>I think I've seen this film before
                    And I didn't like the ending
                    You're not my homeland anymore
                    So what am I defending now?
                    You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
